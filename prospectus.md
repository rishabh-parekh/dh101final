# Individual Project Prospectus

## Introduction
In the United States, no two cities are alike. No two states are alike. Every community has a unique political and social outlook. Individuals view their ‘version’ of the United States through their personal experiences and morals. The terms ‘conservative’ and ‘liberal’ have been misused by mass media to easily split people into two staunchly different groups- despite the fact that one’s viewpoints could lie all over the conservative/liberal spectrum. Regardless, whether one identifies as a conservative or liberal, it is evident that the United States policing problem is a bipartisan issue. According to an August 2019 study by the National Academy of Sciences, “black men were about 2.5 times more likely than white men to be killed by police, and that black men have a 1-in-1,000 chance of dying at the hands of police.” This statistic is one of thousands that indicate how broken America’s criminal justice system truly is. As a UC Berkeley undergraduate student, I was inspired by the work of the Black Lives Movement and The Bail Project, in addition to the recent revolutionary protests. As an immigrant and a minority myself, I was curious to know whether policing behavior changed towards different races, ethnicities, and ages in different political regions in the United States.     

## Research Question
The research topic that I chose to investigate is: are minorities/people of color subject to harsher and more frequent policing stops in major cities, in typically conservative states or liberal states. To clarify, the terms conservative or liberal are related to their state's political ideologies. This topic is extremely relevant to our daily lives. Currently, there are protests and calls for action across the world, regarding the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and countless others who have lost their lives due to unjust policing and racism. Slogans such as #Defundthepolice, have been trending on popular social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram. These social movements have largely been the focus of the media, therefore, with the upcoming Presidential election, it is incredibly vital for the public to have access to the data and stories of policing in their community. 

There has been significant work in highlighting the lapses in criminal justice and policing through data. Efforts from universities such as The Stanford Open Policing Project, organizations such as Police Scorecard, and newspapers such as the Washington Post, routinely publish informative pieces that address whether “there’s overwhelming evidence that the criminal justice system is racist.” These contributions are extremely positive and benefits the collective good by providing continual support to solve police brutality related issues. However, my research project is slightly different, as I am focused on investigating the relationships between policing in politically leaning liberal and conservative regions. The crux of this project is to understand whether there is a strong correlation between policing, regional political ideology, and victim race.  

## Materials & Methods
I will be using multiple datasets from the Stanford Open Policing Project (https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/). This website provides the authentic and unprocessed datasets for crime in cities across the United States. The 8 cities that I have chosen for this project are located in states with varying political ideologies. The cities are San Diego, San Francisco, Nashville, Hartford, Pittsburgh, Charlotte, San Antonio and New Orleans. These locations were chosen because the information provided was the most complete compared to other cities listed on the website. Data contained in these csv files include the crime’s reason for the stop, its location, time, latitude, and longitude data. In addition to this, entries are also added if a citation/warning/search/arrests were made as well as the formal outcome of the reported crime (ie. if the crime ended in a citation or a warning). The subjects’ race, age, and sex are also included within the sets, which are also interesting variables to analyze across these cities for their social and political implications.

I plan to build visualizations mapping crimes in these various cities, locations, types of crime bar charts, victim race type pie charts, Twitter sentiment analysis of recent #policebrutality and #BLM activities on Jupyter, Visual Studio Code, and Twitter Developer API’s. The data is cleaned and available on CSV formats on the  Stanford Open Policing Project website. In addition, I will refer to the README https://github.com/stanford-policylab/opp/blob/master/data_readme.md to understand column name meanings and extra nomenclature.  

## Results
I expect to find a strong correlation between increased policing and racial profiling in conservative regions, compared to liberal regions. I am assuming that political ideology is related to increased police brutality. Additionally, I am assuming that data from the largest cities in a state, is representative of the entire state - which may not be accurate. 

## Discussion
Through this project, I hope to challenge myself as a digital humanities researcher and python programmer. I hope that the findings and visualizations from my project enables viewers to easily digest the complicated relationships of policing data, subject age, subject race, location, time of stop, and punishment. Eventually, I hope this project serves as the genesis for my end goal of developing data science tools that democratize the access to data and the public. I am committed to expanding/broadening my initial project to make more projects at the intersection of data science and public policy - intended for public good.
